This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.


# What is my project about
This is the web site that you can add, edit or delete your favorite quote. 

# What I am using this project for / What is the purpose of this project
I wanted to improve my comprehension of React with Redux.

# Why did you decide to make this project?

I love comedy TV shows and quotes from them, so I've wanted to make a web application that is related to quotes from TV shows. 
I thought the final project was a good opportunity to give form to my idea.

# What reference did you use?

Lots of articles from Qiita, DEV community, or other blogs.
(I should have noted their URLs)

# What libraries/technology/ api you used
- React
- react-modal
- Redux
- Tailwind CSS

## libraries/technology/ api I will implement in the future
- TypeScript
- The Movie Database (TMDb) API
- firebase, firestore


# What did you learn? What was the most challenging part?

My biggest goal of this project was to understand Redux, but interestingly what I could deepen the knowledge most is about React. 
The most challenging part is the component which is using Modal and map function. I should have understood well about rendering.
